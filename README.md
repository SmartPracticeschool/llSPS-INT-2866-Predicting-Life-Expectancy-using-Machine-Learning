## Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning
This is a Machine Learning Model in which we predict life expectancy using different algorithms.
Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time a human being is expected to live. It depends on various factors like Region in which a person lives,Adult Mortality,
Alcohol intake and many more. Here I have a prepared Machine learning Model in Python and also with Auto-AI and integrated them with Node-Red.
